# Bots made by Burny

Bots can be launched against each other as described on [this page](https://github.com/Hannessa/python-sc2-ladderbot).

These bots should work on the AI LadderServer by executing "run.py"

The [LadderBots.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BurnySc2/burny-bots-python-sc2/master/LadderBots.json) shows you how to set up the bot for the LadderServer.
